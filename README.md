# What is this Repo about?
This is me just trying different models and tools to get used to them. With models and tools nowadays being released quicker then marvel movies, the best way I could think of finding those that are actually worth it, is by trying them all xD. 

# Structure
I have multiple folders, each with a project, and its own README where necessary to kinda show what what project is about. I will also keep this README updated with a breif idea about each folder.
